#### Easy circle avatars for your latest as-a-service app.

This is a really basic module to get you up and running w/ circle avatars because we 
all know circle avatars are super legit.

Simply add a `avatar` to a container class for the avatar img and you're rocking.

```html
<a href="/profile/drk" class="avatar">
    <img src="/avatars/drk.jpg" alt="drk avatar">
</a>
```
Yep, that easy!

## Sizes

* xsml – `avatar xsml-avatar`
* sml – `avatar sml-avatar`
* med – `avatar med-avatar` or just `avatar`
* lrg – `avatar lrg-avatar`
* xlrg – `avatar xlrg-avatar`

You can check out the various sizes by running:

```
